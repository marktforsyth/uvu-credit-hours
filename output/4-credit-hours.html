  Provides a foundation in how sensory systems interpret the world. Explores each of
                        the primary sensory systems by defining the physical energy that is detected. Examines
                        how that energy is transduced into neural impulses, and samples how aspects of that
                        information are encoded to provide a representation of our world. Takes a neuroscientific
                        approach to the topic, beginning with an overview of the nervous system, including
                        the organization of the brain and spinal cord, how neurons work, and how neurons communicate
                        with each other.
