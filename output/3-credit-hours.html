  Explores the religious systems of indigenous peoples, particularly those which have
                        been called shamanic. Focuses on the classical study of shamanism and the literature
                        on indigenous shamanism. Locates the study of shamanism within a social context that
                        includes social relational and political economic contexts of the groups within which
                        shamanism is found. Poses questions of how shamanism is different from the expanding
                        world religions and compares and contrasts shamanism with non-shamanic indigenous
                        religions. Analyzes at the current marketing of shamanism in New Age contexts.

  Focuses on the biological and contextual study of human remains recovered from archaeological
                        sites. Presents an updated synthesis of bio-archaeological science dealing with the
                        study of the human skeleton to reconstruct patterns of biological stress, infectious
                        disease, lifestyle and physical activity, diet, violent death, and genetic relationships

  Examines how computers have affected global society and how they could further affect
                        it in the future. Challenges students to (1) examine several types of ethical reasoning
                        to establish an ethical framework to assist in making normative judgments, (2) examine
                        various ethical issues surrounding computer usage, particularly in differing societal
                        contexts, (3) understand the responsibilities they bear, to know how their actions
                        can affect both society and individual people in their own and other cultural setings,
                        and to appreciate both the good and the harm they can do and (4) consider many of
                        the moral and professional issues that those who work with computers might expect
                        to face.

                        science and a greater appreciation of their physical surroundings. Taken in conjunction
                        with laboratory exercises in GEO 1015, the class is sufficiently rigorous to articulate
                        as an introductory geology class.

                        and enjoyment. Teaches how to interpret artistic meaning by analyzing artworks formally
                        as well as in their historical contexts, such as the predominant subject matters and
                        styles of their period.  Encourages students to integrate the arts into their daily
                        lives habitually, so that they become lifelong learners and educators.

  Explores Humanism or Posthumanism across the arts and their diverse cultural history.
                        Defines humanism as varieties of the traditional view that Man is the measure of all
                        things, and Posthumanism as an umbrella term for recent theoretical approaches within
                        the humanities that challenge this view, for instance by placing humanity in the context
                        of global or universal, intrinsically diverse and self-generating, scientific, technological,
                        or ecological systems. May compare aspects of humanism throughout space and time,
                        in its diverse cultural manifestations, or may focus on a twenty-first-century view
                        of these long traditions. May also choose the example of the humanistic or posthumanistic
                        aspects of a single time period, culture, or interdisciplinary oeuvre. Offers an opportunity
                        to advanced students to synthesize, critique, and strengthen their own viewpoints,
                        and to expand their interdisciplinary understanding of human expression, in response
