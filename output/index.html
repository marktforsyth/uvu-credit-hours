  Offers lower division/novice ASL users opportunities to enhance their proficiency
                        in the target language by focusing on production. Teaches how to improve authentic
                        pronunciation, reduce errors in authenticity of language structure, generate thought
                        in the target language spontaneously as a substitute for translation, sharpen comprehension,
                        and develop conversational strategies such as circumlocution and managing a conversation
                        with useful expressions for starting a conversation, gaining time to think, helping
                        interlocutors, seeking agreement, etc. Contrasts with all other first year courses
                        which must strive to produce mastery of the whole range of language acquisition components.
                        Facilitates lowering the affective filter when conversing in the target language by
                        increasing the frequency of production opportunities and defusing concern about new
                        vocabulary and grammar. Increases mastery of lexical items through increased frequency
                        of use. May be repeated for a maximum of 3 credits toward graduation.

  Offers lower division / novice Chinese speakers opportunities to enhance their speaking
                        proficiency in the target language by focusing on oral verbal production. Teaches
                        how to improve authentic pronunciation, reduce errors in authenticity of language
                        structure, generate thought in the target language spontaneously as a substitute for
                        translation, sharpen listening comprehension, and develop conversational strategies
                        such as circumlocution and managing a conversation with useful expressions for starting
                        a conversation, gaining time to think, helping the other speaker, seeking agreement,
                        etc. Contrasts with all other first year courses which must strive to produce mastery
                        of the whole range of language acquisition components, including writing, grammar,
                        etc. Facilitates lowering the affective filter when conversing in the target language
                        by increasing the frequency of speech opportunities and defusing concern for such
                        matters as spelling, etc. Increases mastery of lexical items through increased frequency
                        of oral usage. May be repeated for a maximum of 3 credits toward graduation.

  Offers novice Spanish speakers opportunities to enhance their speaking proficiency
